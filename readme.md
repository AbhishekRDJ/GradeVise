# GradeVise - AI-Powered Education for Real India

## üí° Introduction

**Problem Statement**: Rural India faces significant educational challenges - teachers in government schools, coaching centres, and colleges struggle with heavy workloads while providing individualized feedback in overcrowded classrooms.

**Solution**: GradeVise is an AI-powered Android app specifically designed to address grassroots educational challenges across rural India. Built for "Bharat," our solution goes beyond traditional grading to offer comprehensive educational support including vernacular language learning, dropout prediction analytics, and intelligent teacher assist tools. Through smart features like multilingual classroom creation, automated evaluation in regional languages, and predictive analytics for student performance, the app enables educators to save time while providing personalized support. Students receive instant feedback in their preferred language, progress tracking, early intervention alerts, and tailored learning resources - making quality education accessible and inclusive for all.
